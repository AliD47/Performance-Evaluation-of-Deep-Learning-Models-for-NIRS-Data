# Thesis : Evaluation of deep learning model performance to predict the chemical composition of forage from near-infrared spectroscopy data.

This repository contains the code, report, and results for the final year engineering thesis titled: 
"Évaluation des performances de modèles d'apprentissage profond pour prédire la composition chimique de fourrage à partir de données de spectroscopie en proche infrarouge"

The project evaluates and compares the performance of several deep learning architectures against advanced chemometric methods for predicting six key chemical components in forage samples using a private dataset from CIRAD-Selmet.
